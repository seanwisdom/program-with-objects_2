                            <b>HTML</b> is short for <em>Hypertext Mark Up Language</em> and is the language most commonly used to write code for web pages. The key component of HTML is an <em>element</em>. An element is opened and closed by a <em>tag</em>. Elements are classified as either <em>inline</em> or <em>block</em>. A tag can also have an attribute. For example, the anchor tag uses the <em>href</em> attribute to set the target of the anchor. Following this <a href=www.google.com>link</a> will take you to a search engine that you could use to search for other examples of attributes.

         			        HTML has what is a called a <b>tree structure</b> because elements can have other elements inside them.  This creates a series of <em>nested</em> boxes.  When writing HTML code the indents represent the nesting structure of the boxes.

                            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) add color, design, etc. to your web page.  One of the key concepts in writing code is to limit how often you need to repeat yourself.  You can do this by assigning classes to elements and then styling those classes instead of styling each element.  This reduces the amount of code you need to write (<em>saving time and potential mistakes</em>) and makes changing styles a lot faster and easier.  Elements can also inherit style from their "parents" in the DOM.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There are 3 ways to add style to your webpage.

                            Variables allow you to give names to values.  You assign a value to a variable using the <span class="code">=</span> sign.  The <span class="code">=</span> sign means something completely different in programming versus arithmetic.  You can think of the <span class="code">=</span> sign as meaning <em>"is"</em> instead of <em>"is the same as"</em>.  The value of a variable can also be changed.  Variables can be very useful in programming.  They allow you to:

                            <strong>Lists</strong> are similar to a string.  While a string is a way to store a sequence of characters a list is a method of storing a sequence of anything (e.g. strings, numbers or other lists).  You can use an index on a list to find an item(s) within the list.  A list that's stored within another list is called a <em>nested list</em>.

                            Mutation refers to changing values within a list.  Any value within the list can be changed by finding that value and then replacing it with a new value.  You can also add new elements to the end of a list using the <span class="code">append</span> function.  This changes the existing list.  You can also add two lists together to create a new list using the <span class="code">+</span> operator.

                            <b>Objected Oriented Programming (OOP)</b> is a programming language model based on identifying objects and how they relate to each other and interact.  <em>Objects</em> can be things like people, pets, buttons, navigation bars, etc.  The objects are the primary focus of designing the program.  These objects each have their own role in the program and interact with each other to perform the functions that the program is intended to execute.  Each object is given attributes and has <em>methods</em> associated with it.  The methods are the logic that tell the object what to do within the program.

                            Objected Oriented Programming utilizes a key concept called <em>abstraction</em> to create models for programming.  Abstraction means to utilize a module of code without knowing all of the details about how the code you're utilizing is working. This makes it easier to write more complex code, because you don't have to figure out every detail of the code you're writing.  You can utilize code created and packaged by other programmers to perform functions within your program.

                            There are two types of <em>libraries</em> used in Python.  The <b>Python Standard Libraries</b> that come packaged with Python.  And <b>External Libraries</b> like the Twillio libary we used in one of the project examples we worked on.  External libraries are developed independently and do not come packaged with Python.  Libraries are a collection of modules typically organized around a theme.  A <em>module</em> is a file containing Python definitions and statements. Modules can be called into python code very similarly to how external files can be called into HTML code.

                            In this section we created several programs that introduced us to utilizing classes.  A <em>class</em> is like a blueprint of a building and has certain pre-defined attributes.  There can be multiple instances (objects) of a class.  This instance would be like a specific house built utilizing the blueprint of the class. This is similar to how classes are used in HTML and CSS to group certain elements together and style them consistently.  A change to the class in either will make changes to all of the objects or elements utilizing that class.

                            In this section we learned how to create our own classes and how to use <em>inheritance</em> to make programming easier and faster.  Inheritance means that an instance can inherit methods or attributes from it's parent.  The methods usually get or set information about the instance.  You can also override a method inherited from a parent class by specifying that method in the instance and giving it a new value.  Again, this is all very similar to HTML/CSS which utilizes inheritance as well.
